## Description
This controller implements the pattern formation behavior as from the paper:

**"Provable self-organizing pattern formation by a swarm of robots with limited knowledge."**.
*Mario Coppola, Jian Guo, Eberhard Gill, Guido de Croon, 2019.*
 Mario Coppola, Jian Guo, Eberhard Gill, and Guido C. H. E. de Croon. Swarm Intelligence, 13(1):59--94, Mar 2019.

The paper is available open-access at this link:

The behavior is similar to the one, though, due to the evolutions of Swarmulator since then, it may differ slightly and may require some mild tuning to function in the same way. For the exact same behavior as in the paper, plese see the `SI_PatternFormation` branch of the repository.

It is designed to work with AGENT=particle.
